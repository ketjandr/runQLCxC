# runQLCxC
This is a repository for the CxC hackathon.

## What the repository has:
- An interactive dashboard that gives graphs and insights about the data based on hackathon prompts
    : follow the instructions below to use it.
- Code used to clean, preprocess, and analyze the actual data (in the Analysis Files folder)
- A report that explains the project (the only .pdf file in the project ^^)

Note that the report itself contains limited versions of the graphs available in the dashboard. Thus, please make sure to take a look into the graphs in our dashboard (especially the treemap)!

## How to run the project (dashboard):
- Clone the repository, and do into the cloned directory
- Create virtual envinronment: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate venv: `venv/Scripts/activate`
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the application: `python app.py`

#### And now you have your long-desired interactive dashboard!
